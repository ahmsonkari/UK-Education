# ðŸ§¾ Student Info Extractor from PDF

This Python script automates the extraction of structured student information from scanned or exported PDF documents. It leverages `pdfplumber` to read PDF text, cleans it, and uses **Claude AI (Anthropic)** to convert unstructured text into a structured JSON format.

## ðŸ“Œ Use Case

This tool is designed to simplify the process of extracting key student application details such as:
- Full Name
- Date of Birth
- Nationality
- Address
- Contact Info (Mobile, Email)
- Academic Records (GPA, IELTS Score)
- School Information

It is ideal for **automated application pipelines**, data analysis, or generating reports from PDFs.

## ðŸ§  How It Works

1. âœ… **Reads the PDF** using `pdfplumber`
2. ðŸ§¹ **Cleans and filters the text**, removing Arabic and non-ASCII characters
3. ðŸ¤– **Sends the text to Claude** using Anthropic API
4. ðŸ§¾ **Prints each field individually** from the returned JSON
